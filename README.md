# Mini Project Rest Api

This is a Spring Boot REST API application for managing orders, products and customers.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following tools:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Maven 3.6 or later
- A SQL Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) (recommended using Docker)

## Features

The API provides the following features:

- Managing customers, products, and orders.
- Many-To-Many relationship between orders and products.
- One-To-Many relationship between customers and orders.
- Order flow
- Handling failed scenario when order process

## System Architecture
This application uses a layered architecture pattern, consisting of:

- Controller Layer: The entry point of the application, where the incoming HTTP requests are handled.
- Service Layer: Contains business logic and calls methods from the repository layer.
- Repository Layer: Responsible for data access logic, communicates directly with the database.
- Model (Entity) Layer: Maps directly to the database tables, includes relationships between tables.

- DTO (Data Transfer Object): A simple object that carries data between processes. It's like a carrier pigeonâ€”it doesn't do much processing itself, but it helps move data from one place to another, often from the server to the client.
- Exception: Your application's way of saying "something went wrong" and providing information about the problem. This could be anything from a database connection failing to a user entering invalid data

The application uses Spring Data JPA for the Repository layer which provides a way to reduce boilerplate code to implement data access layers for various persistence stores.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fadhlillah2/order-processing-system.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory.

```bash
cd mini-project-rest-api
```

3. Running the database (if using docker)

```bash
docker compose up
```

4. Build the project.

```bash
mvn clean install
```

5. Run the project.

```bash

mvn spring-boot:run
```

Now, your service should be up and running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

Here are some of the API endpoints that are available:

- `POST /api/v1/customers`: Creates a new customer
- `GET /api/v1/customers/{customerId}`: Retrieves a specific customer
- `PUT /api/v1/customers/{customerId}`: Updates a specific customer
- `POST /api/v1/products`: Creates a new product
- `GET /api/v1/products/{productId}`: Retrieves a specific product
- `PUT /api/v1/products/{productId}`: Updates a specific product
- `POST /api/v1/orders`: Creates a new order
- `GET /api/v1/orders/{orderId}`: Retrieves a specific order

## Acknowledgments

- The structure of the application is designed to follow best practices and conventions of Spring Boot applications.
- Exceptions are handled globally to provide meaningful error messages to clients.
- Data is validated before being processed to ensure integrity.
- Entities are set up to handle various relationships (One-To-Many, Many-To-Many).
